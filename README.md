# TikTok in React

## DISCLAIMER
This web app is absolutely not linked with the actual TikTok company or ByteDance in any way. This is just a project that I decided to build on my own because it looked like it would be fun. I do not have any plans to make this a commercial app or anything of that sort. Just something to put on my CV.

TLDR: Please don't sue me.

## FAQ
### Why TikTok?
No particular reason. I had been wanting to make a "big" project for a while now. I juggled around with the idea of building any one of all the major social media apps and TikTok seemed to be (and I mean this very loosely) the fastest and easiest one to build. 

One of the perks of picking already built huge websites is that I can skip the designing phase, which I absolutely despise.

### Does TikTok use React?
Probably not. Most likely not.
