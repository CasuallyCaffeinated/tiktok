# TikTok in React 🚀
Tiktok, but in Re... yeah you read the title.

## DISCLAIMER
**This web app is absolutely not linked to the actual TikTok company or ByteDance in any way. Tiktok, Tiktok logo, the website and basically everything I used here is a registered trademark/copyright/any other legal ownership thing of ByteDance/Tiktok.** This is just a project that I decided to build on my own because it looked like it would be fun. I do not have any plans to make this a commercial app or anything of that sort. Just something to put on my CV.

_TLDR: Please don't sue me._

## FEATURES
* ✅ Make an account (innovation at it's peak 💯)
* ✅ Upload and like videos
* ✅ Comment on videos and reply to comments (top level)
* ✅ Like comments and replies

* ✅ Watch meme videos I uploaded

* ✅ Uhhhhh
* ✅ Search for videos or users

I am open to suggestions for more features. You can suggest some in the issues tab of this repository.

## TOOLS USED
* Typescript React
* Redux toolkit
* SCSS and its modules
* Font-awesome icons (only the free ones, sorry font-awesome)
* Node js for backend

## DEPLOYMENT
* [Currently deployed on netlify here.](https://sc-react-tiktok.netlify.app/)
* Links will be added here if I change/deploy the website anywhere else.

## ISSUES
* Back button does not close comments modal
  * This is not a solvable issue. The real Tiktok website also has this problem. This is because the back button does not fire any event, so it extremely difficult to know when it is pressed. For the time being, just use the dedicated close button or click outside the comments modal.

Let me know if you find any other bugs/issues.

## Q'N'A
### "Why Tiktok?"
No particular reason. I had been wanting to make a "big 💯👌" project for a while now. I juggled around with the idea of building any one of all the major social media apps and Tiktok seemed to be (and I mean this very loosely) the fastest and easiest one to build. Turns out I was wrong. Very wrong.

One thing that I can assure you is that one person can't (and shouldn't 🙂) re-create big social media websites alone.

### "Does Tiktok use React?"
Yes, actually. At least for the webapp. Next.js to be precise. And I realised just now that Tiktok in React could also just mean the original Tiktok (please don't sue me 😐).

### "How long did it take for you to make this?"
3 months and counting. Started in the first week of November 2021. #Grind😤

### "What if you get sued?"
Please don't 😐
